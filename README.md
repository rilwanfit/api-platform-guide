### Add the first resource

This can be done via adding @ApiResource annotation to any PHP class, which will enable the CRUD endpoints by default.

### Validation

API Platform works nicely with symfony validators and provides useful information to client.

#### How do I add validation?

Validate that the User name can not be blank
